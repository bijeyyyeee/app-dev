## WandaVision: A Genre-bending Exploration of Grief and Trauma

### WandaVision, released in 2021, was a unique and captivating miniseries that transcended the typical superhero genre. It presented a captivating blend of sitcom nostalgia, psychological thriller, and superhero mythology, all woven together to explore themes of grief, trauma, and the power of human connection. The series cleverly utilizes classic sitcom tropes and homages to various television eras, from the 1950s to the early 2000s. This seemingly lighthearted approach provides a stark contrast to the dark undercurrents of Wanda's grief and the unraveling reality of Westview. The sitcom format allows the series to explore Wanda's desire for control and her attempt to create a perfect world, even if it comes at a cost.
